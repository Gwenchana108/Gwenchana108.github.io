            <div class="grid-col-span-3"><br><p><strong>Botanical Force</strong> is a game that allows learners to explore the game environment, 
              while evaluating and collecting resources to cultivate plant growth and selectively propagate plants with desirable 
              characteristics to produce up to 3 new hybrid breeds.

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div><br>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>To accomplish this first objective, we began by investigating and 
                playing other games that were programmed in Construct 3, which was the game engine we would be using, so we would have an idea of 
                what Construct 3 would allow you to do as a programmer. We both watched a lot of videos on Construct 3 and would compare notes of 
                the strengths and weaknesses of the engine.</p><br>

              <p>We also found games that were similar to the core dynamic of our game in that they were also games where collecting and exploring 
                were part of what drove the storyline of the game. In having a game that is geared toward collecting and exploring, the game 
                concept began to move to a constructionist view, where we would be having the learner do tasks that would allow them to build 
                their own knowledge base. There was some direct instruction in the game but our plan was to have that become less and less as 
                the learner progressed through the levels.
               <br><br><br></p></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object1a.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div><br>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>Secondly, it was very important to both of us to design a game that would provide a meaningful learning 
                experience and also as an added benefit, but fun to play!</p><br>
                <p>As we continued to develop our concept, I began to work on character development. I drew side and front views and added arms in simple 
              poses so that she could be animated in the game.<br></p></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Characters.jpg" alt="Characters" width="100%"></div><br>
              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>Christina and I focused on coming up with a solid core loop that would be the understructure of our game 
                and help us to better develop a learning environment for the player that was both fun and challenging.</p><br> 

                <p>Our general idea for the core loop was that the player would explore the environment and collect resources while combatting and overcoming 
                different barriers that could interrupt their success with propagating new plant species. <br><br></p></div> 
                
                <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Learning.png" alt="Chart" width="100%"></div>

                <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>To make sure that actual learning would occur, at this stage we also began thinking about how to assess learning. 
                  The first we looked at was making use of scaffolding assessments to provide in-game help and audiovisual clues when the player feels stuck and 
                  is not sure what actions to perform in order to deploy the right actions in order for successful propagation. We also decided to use the idea of 
                  interweaving hidden/mystery objects to motivate the player to be creative and take risks with their explorations and analysis.</p><br><br></div>       

                
              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object1b.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>And finally, good project management was an integral part. It was not enough to have a strong idea, we also had to 
                figure out our time frames and create a realistic schedule that we could both adhere to.</p><br>  
                <p>I programmed the game, but whenever I would get stuck or find something that was not working, Christina and I would do the research on ways to get 
                around the problem. It was very helpful to have a partner in this aspect. Sometimes in our discussions, we would come up with another solution, just by 
                talking out different scenarios.</p><br> 
                <p>Once the character(s) were developed and finalized, I started working on the environment/world of the game. For each level, there will be a different 
                environment that will gradually become more and more challenging.</p><br><br></div>

                <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p><h1 class="TITLE">Reflections</h1></p><br></div>

                  <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/town.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div><br>

                  <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>I believe all told we had about 30 days or so from start to finish. I remember at first being both excited and a bit 
                    daunted by such a challenge. But it really helped to work with a partner on this project. We both brought just the right amount of excitement, at the 
                    right times, to encourage and cheer each other onward!</p><br>
                    <p>This is one of my favorite projects from grad school. It had so many moving parts and items to track. It was pleasantly challenging.</p><br>
                      <p>Iâ€™m an illustrator but had never done pixel art before. I was surprised that while it is seemingly a very straightforward and easy process, 
                    there was a learning curve in setting up a program to allow it to be done easily. I did the basic painting in an app called Procreate and then 
                    moved the images to Adobe Photoshop, where I build a style sheet of all the background images and sprites!</p><br>
                    <p> Construct 3 at times was maddening and exhilarating! It took about 2 weeks of the 4 to really feel comfortable with it, but I loved working with it. 
                    I really want to learn how to use the Unity game engine and will probably continue to design small things with the Construct 3 engine.</p><br> 
                    <p>I would like to at some point go back and finesse the game a bit. There are definitely elements of it that have timing issues. But overall, 
                    I am very pleased with the final results.</p><br>
