          <div id="par"><p>I have thoroughly enjoyed my studies at University of Missouri - Columbia. The design and developmental classes worked well together to give me an amazing view of the field of Instructional Design. </p><br>

            <p>The word that has become near and dear to my heart is, iterative. Design, be it in the area of art or instruction, is definitely iterative. That thought is both comforting and a bit daunting. It allows you to realize that there is always room for growth and improvement, but it also lets you know that there is definitely room for growth and improvement. Even as it is an idea that under girds Instructional Design, it is an idea that will challenge me to continue to always strive and do better. And not be afraid of that challenge.</p> <br>
            
            Assessments are key to Instructional Design. Assessments are what help give meaning to the iterative process of design. What was needed? What was accomplished? What can be done better? I am somewhat of a naturally inquisitive person, so the assessment aspect of Instructional Design appealed and resonated with me. It’s like a puzzle. The overview of what your stakeholders desire, what is needed by the learner and what the intended outcome should be…how as a designer can you piece these parts together to make a picture that is cohesive and makes sense?</p> <br>
            
            <p>All of the courses really helped shape my view of this course of study, but a few I particular have made a lasting imprint. Interaction Design really changed my view on how things work, why they work, and how do you make them better, to insure your learner the best possible outcome. Attention to detail is key. I think I would be valuable in the marketplace, because I do pay attention to the details and love designing products and projects that are both engaging and fun.</p> <br>
            
            <p>In the research class, I have been quite taken by the study on ethics and how it should shape parameters of studies. In reading about it for the class though, it has challenged me to take those same considerations into any designing I will do. I would like to be a media and content creator, and my reading on ethics reminds me that I should approach it with a view to social responsibility. </p> <br>
            
            <p>Finally, during grad school I realized how much I love learning new software and technology. As I look ahead, that is definitely where I sense a desire for further growth.</p> <br>
            
            <p>I have used Photoshop for years, and always was a bit reluctant to have more than just a cursory relationship with Illustrator. But thanks to the digital media class, I have really learned to love working in Illustrator. And on the heels of that is Adobe After Effects and my all time favorite Adobe XD. I would like to continue to learn more about each program and push the boundaries of my work.</p> <br>
            
            <p>Beyond what I learned about Instructional Design and media, I also loved this program because of the amazing people that I have met along the way. I would never have thought it would be possible to meet and make dear friends online, especially during a time when people all over the world were very shut off from one another. I am very grateful for my time in this program.
