              <h2 class="title">Goal 2: Website Interaction Redesign</h2>
           
        	 <div class="paragraph"> 
          
          
            <div class="grid-col-span-3"><img src="photo/top2.png" alt="Goal2" width="100%"></div> 
            <div class="grid-col-span-3"><p>For this assignment, my teammate, Linda Stinson, and I selected the
               <strong>Community Bible Study</strong> website to redesign. The site in its current state is very difficult to navigate 
               and does not offer much to the user in conveying information about the locations and 
               offerings of the program.
              <br><br></p>
            <p><h2>My Role in Development</h2></p><br>
          
            <p>Codeveloped Survey </p> 
            <p>Designed Features and Pages for the Site </p>
            <p> Created the Prototypes in Adobe XD <br><br><br></p></div>
        
            

              <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p><h1 class="TITLE">Objectives</h1></p><br><br>


              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object2a.png" alt="Goal 2.1" width="100%"></div><br>

              <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p>To meet this objective we began by conducting a survey that would identify ways to make the 
                site more interactive and would better meet the needs of visitors to the site. To aid in this part of the process we created 
                a flow chart that would describe the layout of the site while keeping in mind gestalt theories to help direct the design.</p><br></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-3"><img src="photo/Flowchart.png" alt="Flow Chart" width="100%"><br><br></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p>Areas that were identified as helping to make the site more interactive, were the addition of a 
                location map, a creative space for visitors where they could download “memes” that could be shared, updated information on 
                groups and activities, and more information on current studies.</p><br>

                <p>We also researched several similar sites, added those findings to the survey findings, and began to re-design 
                  the site by developing a design plan, which aided in the design of the low fidelity wireframe prototype.
                  <br><br></p></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/lofi1.png" alt="Low-Fidelity Example" width="100%"></div><br><br>


              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object2b.png" alt="Goal 2.2" width="100%"></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>To meet this objective, we presented our working low fidelity prototype to a peer-review process. 
                The feedback was favorable. We also received suggestions that added clarity and function to the redesign. </p><br> 
                
                <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Section2B.png" alt="BannerPhoto" width="100%"></div><br>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>The high-fidelity prototype was adapted and changed taking into consideration the peer reviews we received.
                Community Bible Study has a huge library of photos that we were able to use for our prototype.</p><br>

                <p>Below is the overview of the number of pages that were created for our high-fidelity prototype. All the pages link correctly and several 
                  the features work even at a prototype level.

                <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p><h1 class="TITLE">Reflections</h1></p><br></div>

                  <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/town.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div>

                  <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>I believe all told we had about 30 days or so from start to finish. I remember at first being both excited and a bit 
                    daunted by such a challenge. But it really helped to work with a partner on this project. We both brought just the right amount of excitement, at the 
                    right times, to encourage and cheer each other onward!</p><br>
                    <p>This is one of my favorite projects from grad school. It had so many moving parts and items to track. It was pleasantly challenging.</p><br>
                      <p>I’m an illustrator but had never done pixel art before. I was surprised that while it is seemingly a very straightforward and easy process, 
                    there was a learning curve in setting up a program to allow it to be done easily. I did the basic painting in an app called Procreate and then 
                    moved the images to Adobe Photoshop, where I build a style sheet of all the background images and sprites!</p><br>
                    <p> Construct 3 at times was maddening and exhilarating! It took about 2 weeks of the 4 to really feel comfortable with it, but I loved working with it. 
                    I really want to learn how to use the Unity game engine and will probably continue to design small things with the Construct 3 engine.</p><br> 
                    <p>I would like to at some point go back and finesse the game a bit. There are definitely elements of it that have timing issues. But overall, 
                    I am very pleased with the final results.</p><br>
