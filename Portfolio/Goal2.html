        	 <div class="paragraph"> 
          
          
            <div class="grid-col-span-3"><img src="photo/top2.png" alt="Goal2" width="100%"></div> 
            <div class="grid-col-span-3"><p>For this assignment, my teammate, Linda Stinson, and I selected the
               <strong>Community Bible Study</strong> website to redesign. The site in its current state is very difficult to navigate 
               and does not offer much to the user in conveying information about the locations and 
               offerings of the program.
              <br><br></p>
            <p><h2>My Role in Development</h2></p><br>
          
            <p>Codeveloped Survey </p> 
            <p>Designed Features and Pages for the Site </p>
            <p> Created the Prototypes in Adobe XD <br><br><br></p></div>
        
            

              <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p><h1 class="TITLE">Objectives</h1></p><br><br>


              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object2a.png" alt="Goal 2.1" width="100%"></div><br>

              <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p>To meet this objective we began by conducting a survey that would identify ways to make the 
                site more interactive and would better meet the needs of visitors to the site. To aid in this part of the process we created 
                a flow chart that would describe the layout of the site while keeping in mind gestalt theories to help direct the design.</p><br></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-3"><img src="photo/Flowchart.png" alt="Flow Chart" width="100%"><br><br></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p>Areas that were identified as helping to make the site more interactive, were the addition of a 
                location map, a creative space for visitors where they could download “memes” that could be shared, updated information on 
                groups and activities, and more information on current studies.</p><br>

                <p>We also researched several similar sites, added those findings to the survey findings, and began to re-design 
                  the site by developing a design plan, which aided in the design of the low fidelity wireframe prototype.
                  <br><br></p></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/lofi1.png" alt="Low-Fidelity Example" width="100%"></div><br><br>


              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object2b.png" alt="Goal 2.2" width="100%"></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>To meet this objective, we presented our working low fidelity prototype to a peer-review process. 
                The feedback was favorable. We also received suggestions that added clarity and function to the redesign. </p><br> 
                
                <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Section2B.png" alt="BannerPhoto" width="100%"></div><br>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>The high-fidelity prototype was adapted and changed taking into consideration the peer reviews we received.
                Community Bible Study has a huge library of photos that we were able to use for our prototype.</p><br>

                <p>Below is the overview of the number of pages that were created for our high-fidelity prototype. All the pages link correctly and several 
                  the features work even at a prototype level.
                <br><br></div>  

                <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Hifiproto.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div><br>


                <p>Once the high fidelity prototype was finished we conducted a usability test and with the feedback we received, we made minor changes 
                  to our final presentation..
                <br><br><br><br><br></div>  

                <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p><h1 class="TITLE">Reflections</h1></p><br></div>

                  <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Banner3.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div><br>
                  <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>This was a challenging project in that there were so many details to track. But one thing that made it a great 
                    experience was getting to work with Linda. We are both hard workers and encouraged each other quite a bit. We spent many hours on the phone comparing 
                    notes on other websites, checking to make sure we hitting our goals of making the site more user friendly and a site that people would return to often.</p><br>
               
                    <p> The peer-review and usability testing were both quite informative. Working on the project you would think that you had covered all bases, 
                      but then would receive feedback that suggested a change here or there. Adding the changes would make something that had been adequate, all of sudden,
                       much better. Both the peer review and usability testing were very helpful and key to 
                      finishing the project well.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>On a personal note, I had never used Adobe XD before, but after a mild learning curve, came to love using it. It gave me a better understanding
                      of the HTML class that I took, and helped make me a little less afraid of working on websites. It was quite challenging to figure out ways to get the prototype to 
                      act like an actual site as far as the "create a meme page" and the contact page. But overall it was a great experience.
                    </p><br>
