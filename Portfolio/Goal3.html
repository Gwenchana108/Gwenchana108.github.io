              Development, in Adobe Captivate.

            <div class="grid-col-span-5"><p><h1 class="TITLE">Objectives</h1></p><br><br>


              

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object3a.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div><br>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>To meet this objective, I chose the project from Rapid Tool Development which was to create a learning module. 
                The module I created was on the topic of facilitation. It’s something that I am responsible for training others in my current position. </p><br></div>


                <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>As to the technology portion of this objective, this module was created in Adobe Captivate, which was 
                  software that I had not worked with before. Out of all of the new software that I have had to learn in grad school, it probably had the 
                  steepest learning curve. Because it is part of the Adobe family of products, I kept expecting it to work like other Adobe products, which 
                  it did not. However once I got used to it, it was okay to work with and probably helped me understand Construct 3 better. 
                </p><br></div>

                <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>The ethics portion of this objective is not as pronounced as the technology part, however in developing the 
                  objective and then the path of the training for this module, I did have to keep in mind some of the ethical aspects that come with training 
                  people in facilitation. Privacy issues are probably one of the biggest items that need to be incorporated into the training. Plus giving the 
                  person taking the training a sense of reassurance that the training will by no means infringe upon their privacy. </p><br></div>



     <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Storyboard.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div>

     <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>To start this project, once the objective(s) were set in place, I created a theme to make the training hopefully a bit more 
       whimsical and enjoyable. I also wanted to reinforce the idea that you don’t become a world-class facilitator overnight. It can be something of a journey. 
               <br><br></p></div>

               <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>With a theme in mind, I worked out a storyboard that would help direct the flow of the training and allow me 
                 to know what artwork and copy would be needed.  One other thing that we had to prepare in class was a branching scenario and a visual 
                 representation of it.<br><br><br></p></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Object3b.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>This was an excellent assignment as far as developing adaptive expertise. I have 
                never trained facilitation in this fashion before, so it took quite a bit of deconstruction to figure out what 
                were the key points that needed to be shown so that the learner could heuristically learn portions that may only 
                be hinted at in this type of training. I found this part of the challenge to be especially engaging.
              </p><br>
                <p>The learning module focuses on three key areas of effective facilitation, procedures, principles, and interpersonal skills. 
                  Each section is a differing point on the map and the learner travels from “town” to “town” learning new skills. 
                  It culminates at their destination where they are able to visit the gift shop and sort postcards, which are actually the 
                  final assessment of the module. Below you can see a few of the pages from the module. The total module is 64 pages in length.<br><br></p></div>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/Facillayout.png" alt="Learning module examples" width="100%"></div><br>

              <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>If at any point the learner gets stuck, they are free to tap the compass in the top 
                right portion of the screen and they are immediately taken back to the main map.

                  <div class="grid-col-span-6"><img src="photo/CitySlide.png" alt="Objective" width="100%"></div><br>

                  <div class="grid-col-span-6"><p>I enjoyed the challenge of this project. When I had initially proposed the idea, 
                    the professor thought it was too big in scope and that I would find myself unable to complete it as the class 
                    was only 8 weeks long. It took a lot of pre-planning and some late nights, but I was able to complete it and even 
                    received a hearty congratulations from the professor.</p><br>
