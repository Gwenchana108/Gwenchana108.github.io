     Hi, my name is Angela Jarecki! I live in the Southwest Houston area. I am an artist, a teacher, and mom to four children. I was an illustrator for Hallmark Greeting Cards for several years before setting out on my own as a freelance artist.

Along with illustrating books and cards, I teach online classes in sculpting, sewing, and drawing. Each course has written instruction, along with photos and videos that I design. Through these classes, I am able to provide a creative outlet for others and interact with people from all over the world.

I am also involved with Community Bible Study, where I am now the Associate Teaching Director.  As ATD, I train small group leaders, write curriculum, and help conduct yearly leadership training.  

I am pursuing a masterâ€™s degree from the University of Missouri in Instructional Design, so I can further develop as a teacher and trainer.
