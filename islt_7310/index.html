<h3>Take a few minutes and get to know me and my work.</h3> 
    <p>My goal is to take the skills that I already possess and add several more through my current studies at the University of Missouri and become an Instructional Designer. My favorite parts of instructional design are the assessments, and the development of the training materials.</p>
    <p>Please take a few moments to visit the various pages of my site. You can get to know me a bit and will find samples of my instructional design work along with examples of my art and classes that I currently teach. Also, there is a contact page where you can send me a message if there is any way that my skills would help you fulfill learning needs you have.</p>
