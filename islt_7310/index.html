<h3>Thank you for taking a few minutes and getting to know me and my work.</h3> 
    <p>I am currently an illustrator and designer, but my goal is to become an Instructional Designer. 
        To help realize this goal I am taking the skills that I already possess and adding several more through my current 
        studies in the <strong>Learning Technologies and Design</strong>, masterâ€™s program at the <strong>University of Missouri.</strong></p> 
    <p>My favorite parts of instructional design are the assessments, and the development of the training materials.</p>
    <p>Please take a few moments to visit the various pages of my site. You can get to know me a bit and will 
        find samples of my instructional design work along with examples of my art and classes that I currently teach. 
        Also, there is a contact page where you can send me a message if there is any way that my skills would help you 
        fulfill learning needs you have.</p>
