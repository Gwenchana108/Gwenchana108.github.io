<p>Hi, my name is Angela Jarecki! I live in the Southwest Houston area. I am an artist, a teacher, and mom to four children. I was an illustrator for <strong>Hallmark Greeting Cards</strong> for several years before setting out on my own as a freelance artist.</p>

 <p>Along with illustrating books and cards, I teach online classes in sculpting, sewing, and drawing. Each course has written instruction, along with photos and videos that I design. <br>Through these classes, I am able to provide a creative outlet for others and interact with people from all over the world.</p> 
    
 <p>I am also involved with Community Bible Study, where I am now the Associate Teaching Director.  As ATD, I train small group leaders, write curriculum, and help conduct yearly leadership training.</p> 
    
 <p>I am pursuing a master’s degree from the <strong></strong>University of Missouri</strong> in Instructional Design, that I will complete in spring of 2022. My undergraduate degree is from <strong>Columbus College of Art and Design</strong>.</p>
